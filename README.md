# Logistic-Regression-Gene-Expression
 In this Project, we use logistic regression to predict biological characteristics ("phenotypes") from gene expression data.
 In addition to the concepts in breast cancer demo, you will learn to:
 - Handle missing data 
 - Perform multi-class logistic classification 
 - Create a confusion matrix 
 - Use L1-regularization for improved estimation in the case of sparse weights
